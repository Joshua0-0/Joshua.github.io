                    Hello nakk, Happy happy birthday!!! I would like you to know that
                    you are one of the reasons why I'm enjoying my life. Everyday,
                    every convos, and every time we spent together talking is a very
                    memorable moment for me. You make everything brighter and make 
                    my life happier. You have a very special place in my heart 💖.

                    <br><br>
                    On your special day, I hope you become the happiest person in the
                    whole universe!! You deserve everything. You are a very strong,
                    kind, beautiful, gorgeous, cute, pretty, hard working, 
                    smart, beautiful, good cook, loving daughter, good friend, 
                    beautiful, pretty, singer, dancer, and most of all you are very 
                    beautiful☺️🫶🫶. You have everything most people want, that's 
                    why many people loves you—including me☺️. 

                    <br><br>
                    I want to thankyou for making me happy, making me kilig, and not 
                    leaving me when we encounter a problem. You always try to fix the
                    problems instead of leaving even though sometimes I'm the 
                    problem🥲 sorryyy🫶. Thank you so much for being the most kind
                    and loving person in the world🫶🫶.

                    <br><br>
                    I have composed this message long ago, so I'm not sure if we're 
                    still together when you finally read this message, but I'm 100% sure that we're both happy and enjoying our lives. If we're still together, you can skip reading
                    this paragraph☺️. But if you read this and we're not together 
                    anymore, I'm really sorryy😔. It means I have failed to keep my 
                    promise that I won't give up. Maybe we both realized that keeping
                    our relationship would be a burden to us because we both know 
                    that what we're doing is wrong, especially on your side. I don't 
                    want you to feel guilty because having a relationship with 
                    different religion is not allowed. Never blame yourself on what 
                    happened to us, it's not your fault, it is my choice to not give 
                    up on our relationship. But maybe love isn't enough? I never 
                    really wanted to end it, but maybe that is what we need. I'm 
                    still hoping that if love finds me again, I hope it's still you 
                    but with the improved version of ourself. But that's only for me,
                    if you want to move on, you're free to do it. I would love to 
                    see you being happy on your choice. Now that we're not together 
                    anymore, I hope you take care of yourself, keep doing the things
                    that will make you happy, and if ever you found your "the one", 
                    I hope he takes a good care of you and will never make you cry. 
                    I'm still sending you a gift for your birthday, take it as a gift
                    of appreciation for making 8/9 months of my life happy, I have 
                    learned lot of things, those 8/9 months are a memories I will 
                    never forget. I hope that you also became happy. I'm still hoping
                    to see you soon so I can pay my ice cream debt on you☺️. 
                    Thankyou so much for everything. I loved you🫶. I will forever be
                    your tayy, bff, and kuya☺️. Enjoy your life and take a good care
                    of yourself🫶. Achieve all you goals in life and never give up I
                    know that you can do it!! Byeee nakk🫶

                    Again, HAPPY BIRTHDAYYY Daisy, disay, dim, bff, nakk, yeoboo, and
                    sometimes nayy☺️. I wish you all the best, I hope you achieve 
                    all your dreams and become the best version of your self, stay
